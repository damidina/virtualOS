# virtualOS

Run a virtual macOS machine on your Apple Silicon computer.

On first start, the latest macOS restore image can be downloaded from Apple servers. After installation has finished, you can start using the virtual machine by performing the initial operating system (OS) setup.

You can configure the following virtual machine parameters:
- CPU count
- RAM
- Screen size
- Shared folder

To use USB disks, you can set the location where VM files are stored.

Unlike other apps on the AppStore, no In-App purchases are required for managing multiple virtual machines, setting CPU count or the amount of RAM.
